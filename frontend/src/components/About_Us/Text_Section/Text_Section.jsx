                Road safety is not just a set of rules; itâ€™s a responsibility we all share. 
                Always follow traffic signals, wear your seatbelt, and avoid distractions while driving. 
                Remember, a few seconds of caution can prevent a lifetime of regret. 
                Together, let's make our roads safer for everyone.
